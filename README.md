# CS 230 Software Design Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains portfolio artifacts from CS 230 Operating Platforms. The primary artifact is the completed software design document created for the client, The Gaming Room. This document demonstrates the design process used to plan a scalable, secure, and maintainable software solution.

## Client Summary and Software Requirements
The client, The Gaming Room, sought to expand their game Draw It or Lose It into a web based, distributed application that could support multiple platforms and users. The software needed to ensure unique game and team names, support scalability, and maintain performance and security across different operating systems and environments.

## Strengths in Developing the Design Document
One area I performed particularly well in was clearly documenting architectural decisions and system constraints. The design document effectively communicated how the application would operate across platforms while addressing memory management, storage, and security concerns. This clarity helped ensure the design was understandable to both technical and non technical stakeholders.

## Value of the Design Process
Working through the design document before coding was extremely helpful in identifying potential challenges early. By analyzing system architecture, operating platform requirements, and design patterns in advance, I was able to think critically about scalability and maintainability before implementation began.

## Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of the design document, I would further expand on performance optimization strategies. Adding more detail about load handling and resource utilization would strengthen the design and provide clearer guidance for future development and scaling.

## Interpreting User Needs in the Design
User needs were interpreted by focusing on functional requirements such as ease of access, responsiveness, and consistency across platforms. These needs were incorporated into the design through architectural choices that prioritized scalability and reliability. Considering user needs is essential because a well designed system must serve the user effectively while remaining technically sound.

## Software Design Approach and Future Strategies
I approached software design by breaking the system into modular components and evaluating how each part interacted with the operating environment. In the future, I would continue using techniques such as architectural modeling, design patterns, and early requirement analysis to design similar software applications more efficiently and effectively.
